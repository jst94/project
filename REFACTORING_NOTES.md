## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

   - Check Python version (3.8+ required)
   - Ensure tkinter is properly installed
   - Try adjusting the opacity in settings

2. **Functionality Issues**:
   - The refactored version has fallback modes for all AI features
   - Check the status bar for market connection issues
   - Use the original version if specific features are needed

3. **Performance Problems**:
   - Close unnecessary tabs
   - Reduce window opacity
   - Disable always-on-top if not needed
